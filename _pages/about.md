I'm a third year graduate student of [School of Software Engineering](https://cose.seu.edu.cn/), [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Juheng Jia](https://jyh-learning.github.io/index.html). I received my B.Eng. degree from [Anhui University](https://www.ahu.edu.cn/).

My primary research interests focus on weakly supervision learning, particularly partial label learning and partial multi-label learning.
