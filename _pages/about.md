# üéà Biography

I am an incoming research assistant at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Prof. Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/). I received my Master degree from the [PALM Lab](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/) at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/) and my Bachelor degree from [Anhui University](https://www.ahu.edu.cn/).


My primary research interests focus on Vision Language Models, Reinforcement Learning and Weakly Supervised Learning.
